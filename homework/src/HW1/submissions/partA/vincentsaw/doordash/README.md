### (1) Violated SOLID Principles
This company violates the **Single Responsibility Principle**. This is because both FoodDeliveryAndTrackingService and DeliverService each handle two responsibilities (deliverFood and trackPackage) rather than a single responsibility.

This company also violates the **Interface Segregation Principle**. This is because if someone needs only one functionality (let's say deliverFood), the current implementation will force them to implement the other unneeded functionality (trackPackage).

### (2) Violation Fixes
To fix both principles' violations, we can simply segregate the services into their own functionality branches, with each of the two branches focusing on either deliverFood-related or trackPackage-related responsibilities.
